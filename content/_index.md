# AWS Single Sign-On for AWS Organization

#### Overview

In this guide, you will learn how to set up **AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO)** to streamline user access and permissions management across multiple AWS accounts within an **AWS Organization**. By integrating AWS SSO, you can centralize authentication, reduce administrative overhead, and improve security posture for your multi-account environment.

#### Key Concepts

#### AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)

**AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a cloud-based service that provides centralized access management and Single Sign-On capabilities for AWS accounts and business applications. AWS SSO allows you to assign fine-grained permissions for users and groups by integrating with AWS Identity Center, providing seamless access without the need for multiple credentials.

#### AWS Organization

An **AWS Organization** is a service that lets you centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. AWS Organization allows you to structure your accounts into **Organizational Units (OUs)**, apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) to control permissions, and simplify billing through a single **Management Account**.

### Organizational Unit (OU)

An **Organizational Unit (OU)** is a logical grouping of AWS accounts within an AWS Organization. OUs help organize accounts for streamlined management and policy enforcement. OUs can be nested, enabling hierarchical structures that support a complex organization layout.

#### Management Account

The **Management Account** is the primary account that manages your entire AWS Organization. This account has the highest level of permissions and is used for setting up organization-wide configurations such as policies, billing consolidation, and centralized access management. All costs incurred by member accounts roll up to the management account for consolidated billing.
