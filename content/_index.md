#### AWS Single Sign-On for Organization

You can grant users in your directory with SSO access to one or more AWS consoles for specific AWS accounts in your AWS organization. 

Afterward, users see only the AWS account icon (for example, Development) that they've been assigned from within their user portal. When they click the icon, they can then choose which IAM role they want to use when signing in to the AWS Management Console for that AWS account.
