#### Granting Single Sign-On (SSO) Access to AWS Accounts in AWS Organizations

In this section, you will learn how to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) access to users within your directory for one or multiple specific AWS accounts within AWS Organizations. Once users are logged in, they will only see the AWS account icon (e.g., *Logging*) that has been assigned to them from their user portal.

Upon clicking the respective icon, users can then choose the IAM role they wish to use when accessing the AWS Console for that particular AWS account.
