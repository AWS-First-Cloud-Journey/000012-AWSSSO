In this section, you will grant Users in your directory SSO access to one or more specific AWS accounts in AWS Organizations. Once logged in, the User will only see the AWS account icon (Example: Logging) that they have been assigned from within their User portal (*User portal*). When they click on the icon, they can choose which IAM Role they want to use when they log into the AWS Console for that AWS account.
