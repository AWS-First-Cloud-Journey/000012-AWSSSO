An OU can contain up to 5 layers of nested OUs within it. You can assign management policies to an OU, and it will apply to all member OUs and member AWS accounts.\nManagement Account Management Account is the AWS account with the highest permissions and can control all other AWS accounts in an AWS Organization.
